REM Description: nConsole is an improved version of Windows Command Prompt, with quick shortcuts,
REM ability to open programs with a phrase,
REM includes custom made tools,
REM and an overall cleaner aesthetic making this GUI more user friendly
REM than the default Windows Command Prompt.

REM File Directories:
REM Default Game short cuts are in '%SYSTEMDRIVE%\DOCUME~1\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Game Shortcuts'
REM Default file location is under '%SYSTEMDRIVE%\nCommand'
REM The Software Shortcuts are in '%SYSTEMDRIVE%\DOCUME~1\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Software' with sub-folders 
REM in the directory: "Games" "Media" "PC" "Social"

REM Tips:
REM I recommended downloading "NOTEPAD++", or you may manually change all "NOTEPAD++" commands to "NOTEPAD" 
REM in the source code.
REM You can type 'GET NOTEPAD++' as a command for nConsole to download "NOTEPAD++"
REM Or type 'DOWN PREREQ' to get all prerequisites.
REM Under '%SYSTEMDRIVE%\nCommand\test' there is a copy of this batch for compiling. You can type 'EDIT' in 
REM nConsole to open up the source codes
REM and type 'COMPILE' to quickly edit and apply changes to nConsole 
REM [Sometimes compile might not work properly, in that case, just exit, and relaunch. New code will be compiled.
REM ie: common bug: goes to another
REM command instead of restarting nConsole]
REM Type 'EDITL' to open up nConsole's folder.
REM Near the bottom of the code, there is a code checker. Follow listed instructions in the code to 
REM test it out. Then 'COMPILE' and type in 'CODE' to test and check for ERRORLEVELS.
REM Typing 'DEBUG' can also open up a debugger, but there may be a lot of false positives.
REM You can type 'nComp' to compress the nConsole directory to create a new build.
